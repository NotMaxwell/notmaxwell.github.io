          Python has earned its spot as one of the most popular programming languages for a reason: it's fast to write, easy to read, and forgiving when you're trying to get something working now. For quick projects, prototypes, automation scripts, and experiments, Python is hard to beat.
        </p>

        <p>
          But let's be honest—people keep trying to force it into places it doesn't belong. Yes, Python is great for AI and data work. No, it's usually not what you should choose to build a large, long-lived application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's the practical breakdown.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Python is excellent for quick projects and prototyping</h2>

        <h3>1. You can build something useful in an afternoon</h3>
        <p>
          Python has a low "startup cost." You write a few lines and you're already getting results. That matters when you're validating an idea, testing a workflow, or building a one-off tool.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Want to scrape a page, process a file, or rename a folder of photos? Python.</li>
          <li>Want to test a new algorithm with real data? Python.</li>
          <li>Want a simple API prototype to prove a concept? Python.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When speed of iteration matters more than perfection, Python shines.
        </p>

        <h3>2. The ecosystem is absurdly practical</h3>
        <p>
          Python's library ecosystem is packed with tools that solve real problems with minimal ceremony:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Requests:</strong> HTTP made simple</li>
          <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> Data wrangling that doesn't require a PhD</li>
          <li><strong>BeautifulSoup:</strong> Web scraping without pain</li>
          <li><strong>FastAPI:</strong> A real API in 10 lines of code</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These aren't aspirational libraries—they work, they're stable, and they save you weeks of time.
        </p>

        <h2>When Python is the wrong choice</h2>

        <h3>Large systems that need to scale</h3>
        <p>
          If you're building something that will run for years, handle millions of requests, and needs to be maintained by a team, Python is often wrong. Not because it's bad—but because:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Runtime performance matters at scale</li>
          <li>Type safety becomes critical</li>
          <li>Refactoring large codebases is harder without compiler feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Go, Rust, Java, TypeScript—these are better bets for systems that need to last.
        </p>

        <h3>Projects that demand predictability</h3>
        <p>
          Python's dynamic nature is a feature when moving fast. It's a bug when you need guarantees.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compiled languages with static types catch entire classes of errors before runtime. Python doesn't.
        </p>

        <h2>The rule of thumb</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Use Python when:</strong> You're moving fast, iterating hard, and the cost of getting it wrong is low.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Don't use Python when:</strong> You need predictability, long-term stability, or performance at scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's not that Python is bad. It's that Python has a specific job, and we keep hiring it for the wrong projects.
